A Halloween costume party is an event where everyone should be dressed up as ghosts, witches, skeletons etc, although in many cases people choose less ghost-related costumes and dress up as pirates, robots, popular shows and videogames characters. Visiting haunted attractions is a different kind of activity! That kind of event is a live show that simulates visiting a haunted house, people might feel like they are in a horror movie. Haunted attractions usually feature scary characters such as horror movie villains or ghosts and zombies.
